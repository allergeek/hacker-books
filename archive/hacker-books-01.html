        - what is this unique thing I can offer?
        <br>
        - how can this be better and different from existing YC book aggregators, book lists?
        <br>
        - why am I doing it (what do I miss in other products)? what are my goals as a reader?
        <br>
        - it's about comments and users recommendations (not YC partners, not Twitter)
        <br>
        - I don't need to see the top popular books as I already know what's on the list, these books have been around for a while, also, the most popular may not be the best, and can be entry-level
        <br>
        - engineers recommend technical books a lot, so the feed is hard to read for a non-technical person
        <br>
        - certainly, need groups by content type, category
        <br>
        - what if I want to talk about this book? HN doesn't have notifications for new comments. Reddit? Add Goodreads?
        <br>
        - blogs? that are recommended in HN comments. Sums up to People (as Authors).
        <br>
        - who recommended this book (meaning people, so include usernames)
        - how many people recommended this book, how this changed over time
        <br>
        - other books recommended by this person (username > books)
        <br>
        - other books recommended by all the people who like this book (indirectly related books)
        <br>
        -NEED comments (disqus) for each book and About page, about page, link to main page, link to news.yc
        <br>
